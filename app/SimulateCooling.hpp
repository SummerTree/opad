// Thermal setup (simulate.cooling, the CoolingAssistant), the content of the "cooling" ToolPanel, its steps as tabs: the guided
// setup of a thermal study of a board, its chips and a heatsink in a vented box, cooled by fans, by fans with the warm air rising
// too (mixed convection, slower), or by natural convection: the box (the bodies it is made of: a base and its lid, a frame and
// its panels), the parts and faces that make heat (a chip joined into its board is a face) with their power and which part is a
// board, how the air moves (fans, each by its openings: an axial fan's, a blower's inlet and outlet, sketch regions drawn on
// its faces, with its datasheet's airflow and pressure; drawn in the view with the air's way; the heatsink it blows through
// with its material; whether the box's vents let them blow what they can), and the run (the
// air solved with OpenFOAM, the parts with CalculiX: sim/cfd.hpp; Quick by default, with an estimate of how long) with its
// results. Every list starts empty (or as the study left it) and is filled by its Add button, which picks in the view and the
// browser while it is on: a click adds, never takes out (Remove does, for the rows chosen). What it sets up is ordinary loads
// (case "Cooling") and a study, written as it is set (each change one step to undo, the loads changed in place), so they show in
// the browser's Simulation folder as the manual commands' do, and can be changed in the Simulation panel afterwards; an AI agent
// sees the same.
